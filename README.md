# tingverse
The tingverse is a set of basic functions for Bioinformatics at Ting Lab of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. It was originally developed by a Cole Nawrocki in 2022, a summer intern aiming to speed up analyses. Much of the principles and code that are integral to the tingverse were taught to Cole by Mike Raabe.
